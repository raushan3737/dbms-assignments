Entities : Hotel, Customer
Customer can be first time user or loyal customer.
Customer can book from only only hotel at a time. A hotel can have many customers.

Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

Solution: 
Based on the given information, we can design a database schema for a hotel booking agency using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model. 


Based on the given information, we can design a database schema for a hotel booking agency using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model.

Step1: Find all entities & thier relationship

Entities: Hotel, Customer

Relationships: Hotel Booking

Primary keys are denoted with an asterisk (*), and foreign keys are denoted with a caret (^). Weak entities are indicated within square brackets [].

Hotel(Hotel_ID(PK), Hotel_Name, Location)

Customer(Customer_ID(PK), Customer_Name, Customer_Address)

First Time Customer

Loyal Customer(*Customer_ID(FK))

Hotel Booking(Booking_ID(PK), Customer_ID(FK), Hotel_ID(FK), Check_in_Date, Check_out_Date)


The "Hotel" entity represents information about each hotel, including its unique ID, name, location, and any other relevant attributes.

The "Customer" entity stores information about customers, including their unique ID, name, address, and other relevant details.

The "First Time Customer" entity represents customers who are booking for the first time.

It is represented as a weak entity since it depends on the "Customer" entity.

The "Loyal Customer" entity represents customers who have booked with the hotel agency before. It is also represented as a weak entity since it depends on the "Customer" entity.


The "Hotel Booking" relationship indicates that a customer can make a booking with a specific hotel. It includes a unique booking ID, customer ID, hotel ID, check-in date, check-out date, and any other relevant attributes.

The "Hotel Booking" entity references both the "Customer" and "Hotel" entities through their respective IDs.

This database schema allows for the storage of information related to hotels, customers, and hotel bookings.

It ensures that a customer can book only one hotel at a time and that a hotel can have many customers.

It distinguishes between first-time customers and loyal customers and maintains the relationships between the entities.
